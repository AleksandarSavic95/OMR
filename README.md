# OMR
Me and my brother's attempt of OMR (Optical Music Recognition) implementation in Python, using OpenCV. In the beginning, we will try to read monophonic photos of printed data. After that, we will try our luck and knowledge in polyphonic pieces (such as piano sheets) and monophonic hand-writings. 

This project was chosen as part of the "Soft computing" course on the fourth year of "Software engineering and information technology" studies.
